A Roblox-based maze generation and solving simulator with real-time visualization and command-line utilities.
(README generated by AI)

## Stack

- **Fusion**: Declarative UI Library to handle UI
- **Charm**: Atomic state library to handle maze & game state
- **CharmSync**: Library to sync state between client & server
- **Remo**: Library to write events & handle networking
- **DocumentService**: Datastore wrapper to handle data saving & data loading
- **Cmdr**: Commands to debug features (maze gen, maze solving, shop debugging)
- **Jest**: Testing framework to test features
- **UILabs**: Storybook library to view UI design

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Multiple generation algorithms
- **Maze Solving**: Multiple solving algorithms
- **Real-time Visualization**: Live maze rendering with debug views
- **Command System**: In-game Cmdr integration for maze manipulation
- **Theme Support**: Dark and Light UI themes
- **Networking**: Synchronized state between client and server
- **Game Economy**: Coin rewards system

## Project Structure

```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Roblox Studio
3. Configure maze settings in `Shared/core/MazeConfig/`
4. Use Cmdr commands to generate and solve mazes

## Contributing

### Before You Start

- Review the codebase structure in `src/`
- Familiarize yourself with the maze types in `Shared/maze/types.luau`
- Check existing algorithms before implementing new ones
- Config prices of new algorithms in `Shared/core/MazeConfig/`

### Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch from `master`
2. Follow the existing code structure and naming conventions
3. Add new algorithms to `Shared/maze/Generation/` or `Shared/maze/Solvers/`
4. Write tests in `Tests/__tests__/`
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description

### Code Guidelines

- Use `.luau` file extensions
- Maintain separation between Client, Server, and Shared code
- Include type definitions for new modules
- Test UI changes with UI-Labs

### Goal of This Project

1. Show how a roblox codebase pairs with existing libraries
